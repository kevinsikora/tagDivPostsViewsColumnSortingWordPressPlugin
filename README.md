# Sikora TagDiv Post Views Sorter (Admin)

**Version:** 1.0.1
**Author:** [Sikora Collective](https://sikoracollective.com/)

Makes the TagDiv Newspaper theme's "Views" column on the WordPress admin Posts page sortable.

## Theme compatibility

This plugin works with the **[Newspaper theme by TagDiv](https://tagdiv.com/newspaper/)**.

The Newspaper theme adds a **Views** column to the admin Posts page (**Posts → All Posts**) and saves each post's view count in the post meta field `post_views_count`. The theme does not let you sort by that column. This plugin adds sorting.

If the Newspaper theme (or its Views column) is not active, the plugin does nothing.

## What it does

- Makes the **Views** column header on the admin Posts page clickable for sorting, like the Title and Date columns.
- Sorts by view count in **descending order** (most viewed first) on the first click. Click again to switch to ascending.
- Treats posts with no recorded view count as 0 views, so they stay in the list.
- Breaks ties between posts with the same view count by publish date.
- Works with the Posts page's existing filters, search, and pagination.

## What it does not do

- **It does not change the database.** The plugin only reads the theme's existing view counts. It creates no options, tables, or post meta, and it has no activation or uninstall routines.
- It does not count views, change view counts, or change how the Views column looks.
- It does not change anything on the public side of the site. It only runs in the WordPress admin.

## Installation

1. In the WordPress admin, go to **Plugins → Add New Plugin → Upload Plugin**.
2. Choose `sikora-tagdiv-post-views-sorter.zip` and click **Install Now**.
3. Click **Activate Plugin**.
4. Go to **Posts → All Posts** and click the **Views** column header.

To remove it, deactivate and delete the plugin from the **Plugins** page. There is no data to clean up.

## How it works (technical)

- On the Posts list screen (`edit.php`, post type `post`), the plugin reads the final list of columns (after every column filter has run) and finds the theme's Views column. It looks for the column key `td_post_views` first, then a column labeled "Views", then any column whose key contains "view".
- It registers that column through the `manage_edit-post_sortable_columns` filter with the orderby value `sikora_td_views`, set to sort descending first.
- When the main admin query is sorted by `sikora_td_views`, a `posts_orderby` filter orders posts by the numeric value of the `post_views_count` meta field. It reads the value with a read-only subquery, so posts with no count are kept and sorted as 0.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or later
- PHP 7.0 or later
- TagDiv Newspaper theme
